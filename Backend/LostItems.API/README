How to run the project

Prerequisites Ensure you have the following installed: .NET SDK 8.0 SQL Server (LocalDB or full Server) EF Core CLI tools (if not, run: dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef)

Connection setup Open the appsettings.json file in the LostItems.API folder and check the connection string (ConnectionStrings). It should look approximately like this: "ConnectionStrings": { "DefaultConnection": "Server=(localdb)\mssqllocaldb;Database=LostItemsDb;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true" } Note: You can change the Server and Database to your own SQL Server settings.

Installing dependencies Before running, you need to fetch all libraries (EF Core, SQL Driver, etc.) that were added in this branch. Open a terminal in the LostItems.API folder and run: dotnet restore

Database Operations (EF Core) Since this is the initial DB setup, you need to apply migrations to create tables in your database.

Creating the database and applying migrations Run the command in the terminal (while inside the LostItems.API folder): dotnet ef database update This command will automatically create the database (if it does not exist) and all tables according to your models.

Creating a new migration (if you changed models) If you added new properties to classes or created new entities: dotnet ef migrations add YourChangeName

Structure of changes in this branch Data/ — contains AppDbContext (or AppDbContent), which manages the DB connection. Models/ (or Entities/) — classes representing DB tables. Program.cs — added the builder.Services.AddDbContext... service to register SQL Server.
